"It's like I told you, I came from outer space
That's how I know your name
I've given up on the human race
I'm gonna blow 'em away

So let me take you to heaven
Take you away from this hell
I want to take you to heaven
Take you away from this hell

I want to take you to heaven
Take you away from this hell
The earth is rollin' a seven
This place is going to be fried"
